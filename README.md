# DesignPatterns
small code snippets to implement design patterns


1. Strategy: coding to interfaces

we move the basic actions which tend to vary in an interface.
use the interface to create classes with varied behaviours.

instantiate these classes in the main class to get varied bahavior.

while creating these classes we use interface.. hence coding to interfaces.

** Prefer Composition over inheritance.

2. Observer: Publisher Subscriber model

** always try to loosely couple the objects that interact


3. Decorator: open close principle
open for extension
close for modification
